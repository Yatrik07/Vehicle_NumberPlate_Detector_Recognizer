# Project : Automatic Number Plate Detection and Recognition (ANPR)

### Problem Statement
Automatic vehicle license plate detection and recognition is a key technique in most
traffic-related applications and is an active research topic in the image processing domain.
As a result, different methods, techniques and algorithms have been developed for
license plate detection and recognition.

### Approach
Due to the varying characteristics of the license plate from country to countries,
like numbering system, colours, the language of characters, style (font) and sizes of a
license plate, further research is still needed in this area.
